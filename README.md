## DevStage Application

<p>Your place for showcase projects.</p>

Can you imagine a I.T social media that you can show all of your carrer progress for all the community? Yeah, we present you guys, DevStage.

Kidding, we gave Github too... ðŸ˜„

## But there's a little big diference... always.

This platform was developed with skills from a Front-end Padawan, guided by Rockeseat Ignite ReactJs Bootcamp.

Here we can see some learning topics:

â€¢ React Basic Syntax;</br> â€¢ Functional Components;</br> â€¢ Props;

...and counting, cause I didn't finished yet. :)
